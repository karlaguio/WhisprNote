# WhisprNote

WhisprNote is a simple Python app that uses OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe audio and GPT to summarize it into clean, bullet-point notes.
Currently working on building Django views, forms, and server-rendered HTML templates to display results dynamically


 ## How to Use
1. Add your `.mp3` file in the folder.
2. Add your OpenAI API key in an `.env` file or set it as an environment variable.
3. Run:
```bash
python app.py
